            <p>I was born in China and Immagrated to Canada in 2015. I have completed my BBA degree in China and also completed 
			Busines IT program at BCIT in 2014. After two years' work, I found I am interested in programing. That is why I enter 
			the CST program. I like sports, such as basketball. I like playing instruments (piano and drum). I am currently 
			playing Destiny 2 and looking for people to play together.</p>
