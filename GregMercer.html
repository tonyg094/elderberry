            <p>Hello. I'm Greg. I enjoy video games and writing. I
            was born in Calgary, Alberta, but I moved during 
            kindergarten and spent most of my life in Summerland, BC.
        		I joined the CST program because of my passion for
        		computers, and my eventual goal of software development.
        		My favorite class, of course, is COMP1111.</p>
            <p>I can be reached at herboshnic@gmail.com.</p>
