                Francisco was born in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, in 1988, but moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, later in the same year. 29 years later he moved to Vancouver, BC, Canada, to start his BCIT CST journey. He likes math, physics, logic puzzles and a lot of games. He doesn't communicate much in real life because he is a computer nerd, but with a keyboard and an internet connection he is way more communicative. He doesn't really like poetry, and definetely he is not good at it, but sometimes he tries it for fun.
