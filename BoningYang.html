            <p>Andy was born in Kunming which is a southwestern city of China. After graduated from high school, Andy went to a university
                in Beijing and got a bachelor degree of engineering. Then he worked for a little while in Beijing, but the tedious work and
				insensive pressure in Beijing made him felt overwhelming. He wants to see the world and seek for new adventure, so he came
				Vancouver and back to school in BCIT. Although Andy likes playing computer games, what he is passionate about is movies. </p>
